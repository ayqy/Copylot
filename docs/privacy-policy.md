# Privacy Policy for MagicCopy

**Last Updated:** December 2024

## Overview

MagicCopy is a Chrome browser extension that helps users intelligently copy web page content in AI-friendly formats. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information when you use our extension.

## Information We Collect

### Data We DO NOT Collect

MagicCopy is designed with privacy in mind. We **do not collect, store, or transmit** any of the following:

- Personal information (name, email, phone number, address)
- Browsing history or website visits
- Web page content you view or copy
- Search queries or user behavior data
- Cookies or tracking data
- Any data that could identify you personally

### Data We DO Collect and Store Locally

The extension only stores the following data **locally on your device**:

- **User Preferences**: Your chosen settings such as:
  - Output format preference (Markdown or Plain Text)
  - Language preference (English or Chinese)
  - Additional information settings (whether to include page title/URL)
  - Extension enable/disable status

This data is stored using Chrome's local storage API (`chrome.storage.local`) and **never leaves your device**.

## How We Use Your Information

The locally stored preferences are used solely to:

- Remember your preferred output format and language settings
- Provide a consistent user experience across browser sessions
- Enable/disable extension functionality based on your preferences

## Data Sharing and Third Parties

We **do not share any data** with third parties because:

- We don't collect any personal or browsing data
- All processing happens locally on your device
- No data is transmitted to external servers
- No analytics or tracking services are used

## Permissions We Request

Our extension requests the following Chrome permissions:

- **storage**: To save your preferences locally on your device
- **clipboardWrite**: To copy formatted content to your clipboard
- **contextMenus**: To provide right-click context menu options for page conversion

These permissions are used solely for the extension's core functionality and not for data collection.

## Data Security

Since all data processing occurs locally on your device and no data is transmitted externally:

- Your copied content never leaves your browser
- Your settings are stored securely using Chrome's built-in storage mechanisms
- No network connections are made for data transmission
- No external servers have access to your information

## Your Rights and Choices

You have complete control over your data:

- **Settings**: You can modify or reset your preferences at any time through the extension popup
- **Uninstall**: Removing the extension will delete all locally stored preferences
- **Disable**: You can disable the extension without losing your settings

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in this document with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
